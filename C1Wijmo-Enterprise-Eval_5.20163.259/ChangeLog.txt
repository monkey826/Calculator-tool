Build Number 5.20163.240                 Build Date: 12/06/2016
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Added support for Angular 2 Ahead-of-Time compiler. 
      .metadata.json files for Wijmo Angular 2 components are added to NpmImages'
      subfolders.
      Check also Breaking Changes section. 
    - Angular 2 specific properties (like isInitialized) and events 
      (like 'initialized'/valueChangedNg/etc) of Wijmo components are now exposed in 
      class declarations in .d.ts and hence available for Intellisense.
* Bug fixes
	- The spaces of the text are removed when export FlexGrid to excel.

* Breaking Changes
	- @WjComonent decorator is removed from the library, because AoT compiler
      doesn't support custom decorators.

      not presumed.
    - A suffix in implementation names of Angular property change events (intended to
      implement two-way binding) has been changed from 'Ng' to 'PC' 
      (e.g. valueChangeNg became valueChangePC).
      Note that these events was not officially documented and their direct usage was 
      not presumed.

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20163.239                 Build Date: 12/04/2016
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Added support for Angular 2.2.
	- Added a getCellElement method to the wijmo.grid.GridPanel class to retrieve the
	  HTMLElement that represents a given cell in the panel.
	- Added Menu.show method to display the menu at arbitrary positions on the screen
	  (context-menu style).
	- Added a twoDigitYearMax property to the culture calendar so users can control the
	  threshold used for converting two-digit year strings into full years.
	  e.g. 
			// changing threshold to 2100, so all values are parsed as 20**
			wijmo.culture.Globalize.calendar.twoDigitYearMax = 2100;
			var dt = wijmo.Globalize.parseDate('30/12', 'yy/MM'); // Dec 2030
	- Added support for showing group *and* column headers in the MultiRow control.
	  This is done by setting the collapsedHeaders property to null (rather than true 
	  or false).

* Bug fixes
	- Script error occurs on applying font, styles or formatting when there is no cells 
	  in the sheet. (TFS 222114)
	- 'Positive number expected' error occurs when insert a chart type in the empty sheet.
	  (TFS 222126)
	- Unlike FlexGrid, data values from collapsed group are not shown in the value filter 
	  list of filter editor. (TFS 221920)
	- GroupHeader exported with encoded HTML to excel. (TFS 220929)
	- All sheets are selected when opening xlsx file in MS Excel. (TFS 221408)
	- Cell formats change from date to number when add/subtract days in date formulas 
	  '=Today()' or '=Now()'. (TFS 222324)
	- Observed multiple issues when setting 'columnCount' and 'rowCount' properties in 
	  the sheet containing groups. (TFS 222693)
	- New added value (number/string value cell range) cannot be deleted properly when 
	  inserting new columns. (TFS 221776)
	- Script errors occur when delete column/row ranges after insert a chart. (TFS 222078)
	- [FlexSheet][Pdf] Column-header row containing checkbox is exported to Pdf. (TFS 222643)
	- Fixed the issue the formula is updated incorrectly when delete rows\columns in the 
	  FlexSheet.

	  bottom.

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20163.237                 Build Date: 11/17/2016
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
	- [FlexGridPdfConverter] added support for FlexSheet.
	- Added support for dataMaps on Boolean FlexGrid columns.
	- Added a dataMap property to the wijmo.grid.filter.ColumnFilter class.
	  This dataMap takes precedence over the owner column's DataMap and 
	  is used to provide the strings displayed by the filter editors.
	  For example, it can be used to change the strings displayed for Boolean
	  column filters from 'true/false' to 'yes/no'.
	- Improved FlexGrid performance when binding to large collections and not
	  limiting grid height (automatically sized grids). This used to cause
	  poor performance since the grid only took its host element into account
	  when virtualizing cells; now it also takes into account the browser
	  window.

* Bug fixes
	- [MultiRowExplorer] Fixed alignment in PDF export. (TFS 204780)
	- Calendar did not handle min/max on the same month properly (TFS 221061)

* Breaking Changes
	- Added an optional 'fn' parameter that was missing in the wijmo.removeEventListener
	  method. This will only break code that called removeEventListener specifying 
	  all optional parameters, which should be rare. The change provides more control
	  over event removal and consistency with the wijmo.addEventListener method.

=========================================================================================

* Improvements
	- Added a new wijmo.viewer module that includes two controls:
		-- ReportViewer: displays server-side generated FlexReport and SSRS reports.
		-- PdfViewer: displays PDF files using a server-side service.
	  Added ReportViewer and PdfViewer samples to show how to use the new controls.
	- Added ability to skip columns of FlexGrid during exporting to Excel. (TFS 195426)

=========================================================================================

* Improvements
	- Angular 2 samples in the Wijmo Enterprise Evaluation build now install Wijmo
	  modules from an online location (instead of a local one used in the rest of builds).
	  A corresponding record in package.json files now looks like this:
	  "dependencies": {
		  "wijmo": "http://prerelease.componentone.com/wijmo5/npm-images/C1Wijmo-Enterprise-Eval-AMD-5.20162.222.tgz",
		  ... another libraries

	  still opened. (TFS 210924)
	- Charts cannot be inserted into the sheet when select the cell ranges containing 
	  different cell count. (TFS 211345) 

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20162.218              Build Date: 10/04/2016
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
	- Added external module versions of Wijmo core modules.
	  Wijmo download zip now includes NpmImages folder with the wijmo-amd, wijmo-commonjs 
	  and wijmo-system subfolders containing Wijmo modules in AMD, CommonJS and System
	  formats respectively.
	  Each of these folders is effectively an NPM image that can be installed using the
	  npm install <path to a folder>
	  command. Alternatively, a corresponding record can be added to an application's 
	  package.json file that will cause Wijmo installation from a local folder to the
	  application's node_modules/wijmo folder, when "npm install" command is executed
	  in the application's root folder. For example:
	  "dependencies": {
		  "wijmo": "../../../../../NpmImages/wijmo-amd",
		  ... other libraries
	  }

	  Currently only Wijmo core and Angular 2 interop modules are represented as 
	  external modules in these folders, the rest of interops are shipping as 
	  conventional global modules. 
	  The culture files (wijmo.culture.<culture_code>) are global modules too, 
	  and should be used in conjunction with Wijmo external modules in the same way
	  as they are used with global modules - by adding them to HTML page using <script> 
	  tag, or in dynamic scenarious by loading them using XMLHttpRequest.

	  One important remark regarding Angular 2 interop modules. Those were external
	  modules from the day one, and referenced Wijmo core modules via global 'wijmo' 
	  variable (e.g. wijmo.grid.FlexGrid). The Angular 2 interop modules under the 
	  NpmImages folder are different: they reference Wijmo core external modules
	  using the TypeScript "import" statement (that transpiles to the appropriate
	  JavaScript code depending on the current module format). For example:
	  import * as wjcGrid from 'wijmo/wijmo.grid';

	  Module names follow the same convention as Angular 2 interop modules,
	  i.e. 'wijmo/' prefix followed by a module name, e.g. 'wijmo/wijmo', 
	  'wijmo/wijmo.input', 'wijmo/wijmo.grid'.

	  Wijmo Angular 2 samples are reworked to use external versions of Wijmo core modules.
	  Their package.json file includes a reference to the NpmImages/wijmo-amd folder 
	  (as shown in the example above) that causes an automatic installation of all necessary 
	  Wijmo code in the node_modules/wijmo folder when you issues an "npm install" command. 
	  Note that this definition works only if you use it from its original location in the
	  Wijmo zip image. If you move a sample to a new location then you need to correct 
	  this path in the sample's package.json.

	  The rest of the samples continue to use conventional global modules.

Build Number 5.20162.216              Build Date: 09/29/2016
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
	- Add word wrap support for saving/loading xlsx file. (TFS 205565)
	- Replaced character-based pencil and asterisk icons used to indicate 
	  edit mode/new template in FlexGrid rows with new glyphs: "pencil" and "asterisk".
	  This makes it possible to hide or customize the icons using CSS.
	- Added FlexGrid.rowEditStartingStarted events to complement the rowEditEnding/Ended
	  events which were already available. Also made rowEditEnding/Ended events fire
	  when canceling edits. These changes make it easier to implement custom behaviors
	  such as edit mode indicators and deep-binding edit undos.
	- Improved FlexGrid.beginningEdit event parameters to set the "data" event parameter
	  to the event that caused the grid to enter edit mode (usually a keyboard or mouse
	  event, or null if the editing was initiated by a call to the startEditing event)

* Bug fixes
	- FlexSheet row height of was lost on exporting to Excel. (TFS 205565)

	- Added support for wijmo.olap controls to Vue/React interops
	- Added Vue/React versions of the OlapIntro sample
	- Added validation support to CollectionView (CollectionView.getError property)
	  and to FlexGrid (FlexGrid.showErrors and FlexGrid.validateEdits properties).
	  When showErrors is set to true, the grid shows validation errors on row headers and cells.
	  When validateEdits is set to true, the grid remains in edit mode while there are validation errors.

* Breaking Changes
	- Changed the arguments of the cellEditEnding event from CellRangeEventArgs to 
	  CellEditEndingEventArgs, which extends the former with a 'stayInEditMode' member.
	  Any code that calls the onCellEditEnding event raiser should be updated as follows:
            // raise grid's cellEditEnding event
            //var e = new wijmo.grid.CellRangeEventArgs(grid.cells, this._rng);
            var e = new wijmo.grid.CellEditEndingEventArgs(grid.cells, this._rng);
            grid.onCellEditEnding(e);
	- FlexSheet: Changed .wj-header-row font and background colors.  To get old styles
	  reset values to: background-color: #4800ff !important; color: #ff6a00 !important;

* Bug fixes
	- Decimal values show full precision when enter numeric formulas. (TFS 208259)
	- Footer panel cannot be exported to Excel XLSX format. (TFS 208269)
	- Filtering is cleared on entering a formula into a cell in a certain scenario.
	  (TFS 208825)
	- Formulae cells were not updated if cell data was set using setCellData method.
	  (TFS 208469)

Build Number 5.20162.203              Build Date: 08/31/2016
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
	- Improved keyboard support in wijmo.Menu. Now users can use the keyboard to open 
	  the menu with (Enter/f4/alt+up/alt+down) and to navigate the options (up/down/
	  autosearch).
	- Angular 2: added support for NgModule system introduced in RC.5. Each Wijmo
	  Ng2 module includes corresponding NgModule that represents the module in Ng2
	  application and exports all its components. NgModule's name is inferred from
	  ES6 module name, e.g. for ES6 module wijmo/wijmo.angular2.grid.filter
	  the name of corresponding NgModule is WjGridFilterModule.
	  Only few samples are reworked so far to use NgModel: InputIntro, FlexGridIntro,
	  ngForms and FlexSheetExplorer. The latter is SPA application that implements
	  lazy modules loading.

* Bug fixes
	- Searching is not working correctly at second time in filter by value editor. 
	  (TFS 204947)
	- Excel file is corrupted when export MultiRow after add a new row containing 'NaN' 
	  cells. (TFS 204946)
	- Conditional filtering without setting filter value does not work properly in unbound
	  sheet. (TFS 204380)
	- Group header cells cannot be entered into editing mode in FlexSheet. (TFS 205648)

=========================================================================================

* Improvements
	- Angular 1/2: added support for cell templates for FlexGrid column footers.
	  WjFlexGridCellTemplate.cellType property now accepts 'ColumnFooter' and 'BottomLeft'
	  to be applied to the corresponding cell types.
	  In order to get a cell value in 'ColumnFooter' cell templates the $value (Angular 1)
	  or cell.value (Angular 2) properties can be used.
	- Added a Gauge.showTicks property that causes linear and radial gauges to show
	  tick marks on the gauge face. The tick marks start from "min" to "max" at every "step".
	  By default, the tick marks are white and 2 pixels in thickness. They can be styled 
	  using a ".wj-gauge .wj-ticks" CSS selector to customize their "stroke" and "stroke-width"
	  values.
	- The FlexGridPdfConverter class now supports MultiRow. (TFS 204780)

* Bug fixes
	- FlexSheet does not handle the clipboard properly. (TFS 204530)
	- Aggregate cells from group header rows cannot be deleted by pressing 'Delete' 
	  key. (TFS 200935)
	- Filter values list shows merged cell contents unlike MS-Excel. (TFS 199443)
	- Filtering remains applying in old column when drag and drop filtered column to new 
	  position. (TFS 200934)
	- Currency and Percentage format of the Cell in MultiRow control cannot be exported 
	  correctly to Excel format. (TFS 204796)
	- Filtering is not retained when unfreeze the frozen pane. (TFS 204887)
	- When Culture is set to Japanese, date and currency columns are not exported correctly
	  to Excel format. (TFS 204797)

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20162.201              Build Date: 08/23/2016
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
	- Added support for column footers panel on the FlexGrid.
	  Column footers have their own 'columnFooters' grid panel (similar to columnHeaders 
	  and rowHeaders). To add column footers to a grid, add one or more rows to its
	  columnFooters panel. For example:
		grid.columnFooters.rows.push(new wijmo.grid.GroupRow())
	  In this example, we added a GroupRow, which will cause the grid to automatically
	  display the aggregates set in each Column.
	  Alternatively, you could add on or more regular rows, and set the cell contents of 
	  those row using the columnFooters.setCellData method:
		grid.columnFooters.rows.push(new wijmo.grid.Row());
		grid.columnFooters.setCellData(0, 0, 'column footer value');

* Bug fixes
	- Alphabetic characters cannot be entered in date and numeric columns after imported an 
	  Excel file. (TFS 204082)
	- Filter by value is not working correctly when filter by value twice in the same 
	  column. (TFS 204339)
	- FlexSheet cross-sheet formulas don't update in other sheets when value is changed. 
	  Only update when the cell containing the formula is double-clicked. (TFS 203786)
	- Console error occurs and filter editor cannot be opened when the sheet is frozen.
	  (TFS 204376)
	- Error occurs on opening filter editor after load an empty Excel file into the 
	  FlexSheet. (TFS 204385)

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20162.200              Build Date: 08/18/2016
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
	- Improved the layout of the on-line help system.
	- Added a new interop module for React: wijmo.react.js.
	- Added a new interop module for Vue: wijmo.vue.js.
	- Added a new FlexGrid.newRowAtTop property to control whether the new row template
	  should be displayed at the top or at the bottom of the data rows.
	- Improved FlexGrid scrolling with frozen cells (used to be a little jerky in IE).
	- Improved performance of Row/Col.IsSelected method.
	- Improved performance of FlexGrid.preserveOutlineState property.
	- Added an optional 'dataItem' parameter to the DataMap.getDisplayValues method.
	  The dataItem can be used to restrict the list of display values based on properties
	  of the data item being rendered/edited (see http://wijmo.com/topic/flexgrid-datamap-that-is-row-dependent/).
	- Angular 2 - added the autoSizeRows boolean property to the wjFlexGridCellTemplate
	  directive that allows to disable automatic row height expansion.
	- Added support for "deep-binding" to the ListBox control (e.g. "customer.name").
	- Add a new charting control: FlexRadar for creating radar and polar charts. 
	  The control is in new module: wijmo.chart.radar.js.
	  FlexRadarIntro samples (PureJs, Angular 1/2) are added to demonstrate the new
	  control's features.

* Bug fixes
	- Filter editor does not open and console error occurs after load an Excel file which 
	  contains hidden rows and columns. (TFS 201600)
	- The 'collapsed' state of the row is wrong after exporting to xlsx file. 
	- Angular 1/2 - a cell of a hierarchical FlexGrid (with childItemsPath defined) can't
	  be edited if a cell template is applied to the cell.
	- Angular 2 - fixed problem with FlexGrid.autoSizeRows/autoSizeColumns methods with
	  templated cells.
	- FlexGrid export row's fill color changes into blue. (TFS 202707)
	- groupHeaderFormat can't be applied when exporting to Excel. (TFS 202908)
	- Some events of FlexSheet control do not fire properly. (TFS 202760)

Build Number 5.20162.192              Build Date: 07/12/2016
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
	- Angular 2: added support for Angular forms. The ngForms sample demonstrates the 
	  feature.
	  The implementation is based on the *new* forms implementation from the @angular/forms 
	  module, instead of *deprecated* forms stuff from the @angular/common module – 
	  see the documentation on the new forms stuff here: 
	  https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/forms.html .
	  The dynamic forms scenario described here
	  https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/dynamic-form.html
	  is supported as well. The ngForms sample includes the modified
	  version of the abovementioned Dynamic Forms example that uses
	  Wijmo input components.
	- Angular 2: tested against RC.4.
	- Added a few class names to FlexGrid elements to enable more flexible CSS-based
	  styling. The new class names are:
        wj-elem-collapse  Element that holds the expand/collapse glyphs in group rows
        wj-elem-dropdown  Element that holds the drop-down glyph in data-mapped cells
        wj-elem-filter    Element that holds the filter glyph in column headers
	- Added a "wj-autocomplete-match" class to define the default style used for 
	  highlighting AutoComplete matches (can be overridden by the cssClass property).
	- Added an AutoComplete.searchMemberPath property that allows you to specify 
	  item properties to use when searching (in addition to displayMemberPath).
	- Added an 'isReadOnly' property to all input controls (DropDown, InputNumber, Calendar).
	  This prevents users from changing the value, but still allows selection, focus, and events.
      It is equivalent to the 'readonly' property in HTML input elements, but also prevents
	  editing with the mouse (drop-downs, buttons, wheel).
	- Added a selectionMode property to the InputDate and Calendar controls to allow 
	  selecting months rather than specific days.
	- Added specific class names to derived controls (for example, the ComboBox control host
	  element now has class wj-combobox in addition to wj-control and wj-dropdown).
	- Improved CSS to keep InputDate calendar width constant as the user navigates months
	  in IE.
	- Made input controls switch the 'for' attribute of labels targeting the host element 
	  so they target the inner input element instead. For example:
	      <label for="inputDate">Departure:</label>
	      <wj-input-date id="inputDate"></wj-input-date>
	  The InputDate will automatically set the id to its inner input element to 'inputDate.input'
	  and will switch the "for" attribute of the label to target the input element instead.
	- Added undo/redo processing for inserting/removing chart in FlexSheet. (TFS 191085)
	- Added a new 'wj-state-empty' class to controls that contains empty input elements.
	  This class can be used in CSS selectors along with the wj-state-focused class.
	- Allow empty strings on masked inputs when "isRequired" is false.

* Breaking changes
	- Replaced some custom attributes used by the FlexGrid control with class names 
	  for better W3C compliance and CSS support:
		"wj-collapse" attribute was replaced with "wj-elem-collapse" class name
		"wj-dropdown" attribute was replaced with "wj-elem-dropdown" class name
		"wj-filter" attribute was replaced with "wj-elem-filter" class name
	  This change may affect applications that customize the display of node cells.
	  For example, you should replace:
		cell.innerHTML = '<span wj-collapse class="glyphicon ...
	  With
		cell.innerHTML = '<span class="wj-elem-collapse glyphicon ...
	- Deprecated 'disabled' and 'required' properties on all controls and replaced them
	  with 'isDisabled' and 'isRequired'. This avoids conflicts with HTML attributes
	  in markup. The old properties still work, but will be removed in a future release,
	  so this is not a breaking change yet, but will be.

* Bug fixes
	- 'Year Quarter' and 'Fiscal Year Quarter' formats cannot be exported correctly to XLSX 
	  file. (TFS 197681)

* Improvements
	- Added wijmo.chart.hierarchical.Sunburst control. The control displays hierarhical 
	  data as multi-level pie charts.
	- Added wijmo.chart.analytics.Waterfall class. The Waterfall series represents data
	  values with cumulative effects(Waterfall chart).
	- wijmo.pdf - added support for drawing SVG images (the PdfPageArea.drawSvg method).
	- Added customized filter for FlexSheet, make the filtering behave exactly like in Excel.
	- Updated the cell ranges processing in formula that Insert/delete row/column will update 
	  affected cell ranges in formulas.
	- Added a CollectionView.sortComparer property to support using custom value 
	  comparers such as Dave Koele's "natural sorting": http://www.davekoelle.com/alphanum.html
	- Added JavaScript Intellisense support, see the Intellisense folder in Wijmo zip.
	- Angular 2 - adapted to Angular 2 RC.3
	- Angular 2: the 'initialized' event and 'isInitialized' boolean property are added
	  to all components. The event triggers when the bindings on the component and all
	  its child components have been initialized, and the property changes its value
	  from false to true at this moment.
	  Note that 'isInitialized' is a dynamic property, in a sense is that it's not 
	  exposed as a TypeScript property out of the component interface, so it should be
	  read using the component['isInitialized'] syntax.

* Bug fixes
	- When undo the current cell in editing mode with 'Ctrl + Z', original value is not 
	  restored in editing cell. (TFS 189582)
	- Filtering by conditions (Equals and Does not equal) is not working correctly in Date,
	  Numeric and Checkbox columns. (TFS 190543)
	- Angular 1/2: FlexGrid row heights may grow infinitely if grid performs cells merging
	  and uses cell templates.
	- FlexSheet Filter values list does not include only items that are not excluded by 
	  other filters like FlexGrid. (TFS 194375)
	- FlexSheet Filtering is cleared unintentionally in unbound sheet when insert/delete 
	  column or row. (TFS 194311)
	- Sheets navigation is not working correctly when there is many sheets and direction 
	  of the FlexSheet is Right To Left. (TFS 192724)
	- FlexSheet filtering is cleared unintentionally when sorting a column. (TFS 195517)
	- Formula drop-down cannot be opened by entering "=" if SelectionMode is set to 
	  non-default value. (TFS 195513)
	- Sheet tabs and new sheet tab are not able to see in Right to Left sheet. (TFS 196273)
	- Incorrect values are shown in formula cells when delete a cell from formula cell 
	  range. (TFS 197166)
	- Undo/redo action cannot be done at once after Inserting/deleting rows/columns like 
	  MS-Excel. (TFS 197005)
	- Sheets navigation is not working correctly in IE and FireFox when there is many 
	  sheets and direction of the FlexSheet is Right To Left. (TFS 192724)

	- Script errors occur when 'wijmo.grid.sheet.filter.min.js' is not included as script
	  reference in Benchmark sample. (TFS 190312)
	- Multiple console errors are observed and empty sheet is displayed in Ng2 ExcelBook,
	  FlexSheetIntro and FlexSheetExplorer sample. (TFS 190260)
	- Drop marker and tooltip do not show while dragging a row. (TFS 190542)

* Breaking changes
	- The CollectionView.moveCurrentToPrevious method used to allow moving the cursor to
	  position -1. Now it stops moving when the cursor reaches the first item (position zero).
	  This was done for two reasons:
	  1) To make the method more convenient to use in typical first/prev/next/last VCR-style 
	     navigation buttons (the 'prev' button can now be linked to moveCurrentToPrevious 
		 without any additional tests), and
	  2) To improve consistency with the moveCurrentToNext method, which stopped at the last 
	     item in the collection.

* Improvements
	- Improved keyboard/focus handling in Popup control (TFS 148651)
	- Improved the FlexGridFilter value filters to behave more like Excel (TFS 133354)
	  The values shown for a column include only items that are not excluded by other filters. 
	  For example, if you filter a list by 'name' and that results in two items being shown, 
	  other field filters will only show the values of those two items.
	- Added new settings to AllowResizing enum to allow resizing rows and columns by
	  dragging the edges of scrollable (non-header) cells. This is especially useful when
	  headers are hidden (see headersVisibility). The updated settings are
		export enum AllowResizing {
	        None
			Columns,
			Rows,
			Both,
			ColumnsAllCells, // resize columns by dragging cell edges
			RowsAllCells,	 // resize rows by dragging cell edges

	  CollectionView class to use a stable sort algorithm which is 30 to 50% slower
	  than the native sort but maintains the relative order of records with equal keys.

* Breaking changes
    - The wijmo.xlsx.XlsxConverter class is deprecated. Use the wijmo.xlsx.Workbook
      class instead. XlsxConverter is still supported for compatibility and will be
      eliminated in the future releases.
    - wijmo.grid.xlsx.FlexGridXlsxConverter class:
        -- the 'export', 'toWorkbookOM', 'import' and 'fromWorkbookOM' methods are deprecated.
           Use the 'save' and 'load' methods instead. The old methods are still supported for 
           compatibility and will be eliminated in the future releases.
    - wijmo.grid.sheet.FlexSheet class:
        -- saveToWorkbookOM and loadFromWorkbookOM methods are deprecated. 
           Use the 'save' and 'load' methods instead. The old methods are still supported for

	- Changed the default value of the InputTime.step property to 15 (which seems
	  to be the most common/useful setting). This causes the control to display
	  the drop-down button by default; to remove the button, set the step property
	  to null.
	- Added support for opening FlexGrid.dataMap dropdowns using the keyboard
	  (F4, alt+up/down, like WinForms and WPF/Excel) (TFS 124408)
	- Improved the Control.dispose method to remove all Wijmo event listeners from the control
	  being disposed (dispose also removes all HTML event listeners added with the 
	  Control.addEventListener method).
	- Added a DropDown.autoExpandSelection property that determines whether input 
	  controls should automatically select whole words/numbers when clicked.
	  This applies to all controls that derive from DropDown, and makes it easier
	  to edit dates, times, colors, etc.
	- Added a ComboBox.headerPath property that allows decoupling the values shown in
	  the combo's input element from the values shown in the drop-down list.
	- Improved Globalize to support formatting of fiscal years and quarters with the 
	  following format specifiers:
		- 'EEEE': government fiscal year
		- 'eeee': corporations fiscal year
		- 'U': government fiscal quarter
		- 'u': corporations fiscal quarter
	  The conversion from calendar to fiscal date is culture-dependent. If you are 
	  not using the appropriate culture file (and don't want to), then you can 
	  specify the conversion factor by setting the 
	  wijmo.culture.Globalize.calendar.fiscalYearOffset variable to an array
	  containing two integers that represent the offset (in months) of the start of 
	  the fiscal year for government and for the private sector.
	  For example, the Japanese culture uses a three month offset for the government's
	  fiscal year and no offset for the private sector:
	      wijmo.culture.Globalize.calendar.fiscalYearOffsets = [3, 0];
    - Added five new glyphs to wijmo.css:
		wj-glyph-step-forward
		wj-glyph-step-backward
		wj-glyph-file
		wj-glyph-calendar
		wj-glyph-clock
	- Added automatic label rotation for FlexChart category x-axis. The labels are 
	  rotated to avoid overlapping if axis.labelAngle is not specified.	
	- Used IntelliSpell to spell-check all the documentation.
    - The FlexGridXlsxConverter class now supports row headers export. The behavior
      is controlled by the IFlexGridXlsxExportOptions.includeRowHeaders property.

* Breaking changes
    - wijmo.grid.xlsx module, the IFlexGridXlsxExportOptions interface:
        - 'needGetCellStyle' property has been renamed to 'includeCellStyles'. 
        - 'includeColumnHeader' property has been renamed to 'includeColumnHeaders' (ending 's'). 
      The old property names have been deprecated and will be removed in future builds.

=========================================================================================

* Improvements
	- Improved InputMask handling of delete key with masks that contain numbers in the
	  template (e.g. "99-55-9999", TFS 136087).
	- Add minScale/maxScale to RangeSelector extension for controlling the valid range.
	- Added FlexGrid.selectedRows and selectedItems properties. Both can be used to get
	  a list with the currently selected rows or their associated data items. When the
	  selectionMode property is set to ListBox, they can also be used to set the selected 
	  rows or data items.
	- Refactored wijmo.grid.filter.FlexGrid filter by removing the OData-specific 
	  getODataFilterDefinition method and replacing it with a call to the collection
	  view's updateFilterDefinition method; which if present updates the filter definition
	  used on the server-side. This refactoring allows other CollectionView implementations
	  (such as BreezeCollectionView) to support server-side filtering.
	- Improved BreezeCollectionView sample to show server-side filtering (TFS 129832).
	- Added support for Japanese characters (IME, Katakana, Hiragana) in InputMask control.
	- Added a FlexGrid.showAlternatingRows property to allow disabling alternate row
	  styling without changing any CSS rules.
	- Added a FlexGrid.updatedView event that fires when the grid finishes creating/updating 
	  the cell elements for the current view (e.g. after binding, refreshing, resizing, 
	  scrolling, etc.)

* Bug fixes
	- InputDate control did not preserve the time part of the value being edited.

	- Improved wijmo.grid.filter.FlexGridFilter to allow filtering with merged headers.
	- Improved auto-generated column headers.
	  (we now capitalize first letter, break up camel-case binding strings, so the header
	  for a column bound to the 'productName' property becomes 'Product Name' be default).
    - Optimized wijmo.closest method to use 'matches' method instead of 'querySelectorAll'.
	- Improved InputNumber control behavior on mobile devices.
    - Added a FlexGrid.stickyHeaders property that keeps column header cells in view
	  even when the top of the grid scrolls off view.
	- Improved CollectionView change tracking to ignore items that are added and 
	  subsequently removed in the same session.
	- Improved Globalize to support formatting of date quarters with the 'q' or 'Q'
	  format specifiers (e.g. format(someDate, 'yyyy "Q"q') => '2014 Q4').

* Bug fixes

=========================================================================================

* Improvements
	- Added FlexGrid.pastingCell/pastedCell events. These events fire while the grid 
	  is pasting data into individual cells. Previously, the grid would fire editing
	  events in these situations, but that led to some ambiguities that affected the
	  implementation of custom editors.

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20152.85              Build Date: 09/13/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Improved Angular FlexGrid.CellEdit template to use the character that was typed
	  when initiating the edits (as the built-in editors do).
	- Added a wijmo.odata.ODataVirtualCollectionView class that loads data on demand.
	  See the VirtualData sample for details.
	- ODataCollectionView.filterDefinition property is applied to filter on the server
	  even when filterOnServer is set to false. This allows applications to apply 
	  server and client-side filtering to the same collection.
	- Made FlexGrid.cellFactory property get/set.
	- Added a wijmo.grid.DataMap.isEditable property to allow users to enter data that
	  is not on the DataMap (mapped items become non-exclusive options).
    - wj-menu-item directive now supports AngularJS interpolation expressions and
      directives inside it, and can be used in conjunction with ng-repeat/ng-if
      directives.
    - Data-bound Menu controls now support wj-item-template directive that allows to
      define an arbitrary menu item content.
    - ng-class AngularJS directive is now supported on the wj-flex-grid-column and
      wj-flex-grid-cell-template directives.

* Bug fixes
	- CollectionView.removeAt method issued a notification event with index==-1 instead
	  of the original index of the item that was removed.
	- FlexGrid MergeManager did not always behave consistently when merging ranges that
	  included both row and column merging (TFS 129001)

* Breaking changes
    - Wijmo directives for AngularJS no longer update controller properties bound to 
      by-ref ('=') properties that logically suppose one-way binding.


=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20152.84              Build Date: 08/27/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
	- Added a FlexGrid.showMarquee property that determines whether the grid should display
	  an Excel-style marquee around the current selection. The marquee may be styled using
	  the "wj-marquee" class selector.
	- Added a FlexGrid.showSelectedHeaders property that determines whether the grid should 
	  add a "wj-state-multi-selected" class selector to row and/or column header elements;
	  these can be used in CSS to highlight header cells that correspond to the current selection.
	- Added a new 'clip' parameter to the FlexGrid.getMergedRange method; if true (the default), 
	  the method clips the merged range to the current view range.
	  The 'clip' parameter has no effect on grid; it was added to facilitate the development 
	  of export utilities, which may need to get merged ranges that are not clipped to the 
	  grid's current view range.
	- Added Calendar.itemValidator and InputDate.itemValidator properties to enable preventing
	  certain days from being selected.
	- Added a Calendar.formatItem event to complement the Calendar.itemFormatter property.
	- LinearGauge now accounts for thumbSize when dimensioning the gauge's face.

* Bug fixes
	- Improved touch support in editable Gauges.
	- Fixed problem with chart type initialization in constructor parameter(TFS 125747).
    - Pie chart labels displayed correctly when it's position = 'Outside'(TFS 125423).
	- Chart does not change color's alpha if it was specified as rgba in palette (TFS 119543).

* Breaking changes

	- We made a small change to the logic that assigns classes to FlexGrid cells. Before, we 
	  removed the wj-group class from selected cells. That is no longer the case. There are 
	  two reasons for this change:

	  1) Correctness. Group cells remain group cells even when they are selected. Keeping the
	     wj-group class allows you to use CSS to style grouped and selected cells independently.
	  2) Performance. The new code is (very slightly) more efficient.

	  This change could break your custom FlexGrid CSS. If you have CSS rules that affect group 
	  colors they should be modified to exclude selected cells. In other words, if you had a 
	  rule like this:

		.wj-group {
			background: green;
		}

	  You should change it to this:

		.wj-group:not(.wj-state-selected):not(.wj-state-multi-selected) {
			background: green;
		}

Build Number 5.20152.76              Build Date: 08/13/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
	- Added a new 'wj-state-focused' class to controls that contains the focus. This 
	  class is toggled automatically to reflect the control's focus state and can be 
	  used in CSS selectors to add focus-related styles to parts of focused controls,
	  such as gauge cursors, chart series, and grid ranges.
    - Added Angular attributes for chart series axisX and axisY (TFS 122055).
	- Added wijmo.input.DropDown.isDroppedDownChanging event to allow for customization
	  of the drop-down before it is shown.
	- Added wijmo.grid.filter.ValueFiler.uniqueValues property to specify the list of values 
	  to be shown on the list, which is more efficient than building the list from the data
	  and works on collections that are filtered on the server.
    - Improved features and performance of Globalize.formatDate and parseDate methods.
	- Added scaling specifiers to Globalization.formatNumber and parseFloat. For example,
	  'n0,' divides the value by one thousand, 'n0,,' by one million, and 'n0,,,' by one 
	  billion. The scaling specifiers are especially useful in charts based on large values
	  so the axis display scaled values which are easier to read and take up less space.
	- Added a Gauge.thumbSize property that enables displaying a 'thumb' element to show
	  the current value at the end of the 'pointer' range. This applies to linear and 
	  radial gauges.
	- Added mouse wheel support to editable Gauges.

* Bug fixes
	- Prevented AutoComplete from selecting all the text while the user types.
    - Fixed problem with toggling data series visibility for multiple y-axes(TFS 122051).
    - Fixed error in chart hit test demo(Explorer sample) TFS 124526.

    - Axis ticks and grid lines rendered properly with overlapped axis labels(TFS 125273).
    - Chart focus events fire correctly in IE(TFS 124275).
    - Candlestick and HighLowOpenClose chart types now support 'rotated' property(TFS 118721).
    - Fixed problem with series visibility toggle when there are hidden series(TFS 110615). 
    - Fixed problem with major and minor grid lines for category x-axis(TFS 110250).
    - Chart updated correctly after changing axis 'reversed' property(TFS 100492).
    - Added angular attribute for axis 'overlappingLabels' property(TFS 98919).

        Annotations:
            Circle
            Ellipse
            Image
            Line

=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Improved scrolling performance in IE (found out that border-radius on the host 
      element seriously degraded rendering performance in IE, so now we set it to zero).
    - Added wijmo.setText method to set or clear the content of HTML elements as 
      efficiently as possible.
    - Added FlexGridFilter.filterDefinitions property to serialize filters to/from JSON.
    - Added ListBox.formatItem event (same semantics as FlexGrid.formatItem)
    - Added support for Excel shortcuts: ctrl+A = select all, shift+Enter: select up.

* Bug fixes
    - Added FlexGrid row/column drag support in IE9
    - Column filters were not positioned properly in right-to-left grids (TFS 117022)
    - FlexGrid did not initialize layout when used in an ngDialog in Chrome (TFS 116340)

=========================================================================================

    - Improved FlexGrid cell templates for Angular performance.
    - Improved CollectionView grouping and sorting performance.
    - wj-tooltip Angular directive now supports interpolated values.
    - Added disposeAll static method to the Control class to make it easier

    - Added add/removeEventListener methods to the Control class to make it easier 
      to remove event listeners when the control is disposed.

* Bug fixes
    - FlexPie's tooltips work correctly with different combinations of selectedItemOffset
      and selectedItemPosition properties (TFS 114962).
    - FlexChart itemFormatter had no effect for candle chart (TFS 115512). 

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20151.48          Build Date: 04/10/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Added a Control.disabled property (maps to disabled attribute of the host element)
    - Added class names to facilitate custom styling of column headers: 
        wj-sort-asc (column is sorted in ascending order)
        wj-sort-desc (column is sorted in descending order)
        wj-filter-on (column has an active filter)
        wj-filter-off (column has an inactive filter)
* Bug fixes
    - FlexGrid's Row/Column isContentHtml property was not honored in group row headers (TFS 114902)

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20151.47          Build Date: 04/08/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Improved FlexGrid cell templates for Angular performance.
    - Changed FlexGrid mouse handler to sort/select on left button only (TFS 114623)
      (reserving the right button for context menus)
* Bug fixes
    - Allow wj-context-menu directive on element level directives.
    - Fixed FlexGrid hit-testing after window resize (TFS 112961)

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20151.45          Build Date: 04/02/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Improved grid filter to support value and condition filtering.
    - Added a Menu.isButton property that turns menus into split-buttons.
    - Input and Gauge directives can bind using ng-model directive now, gaining 
      the features specific to ng-model this way.
    - Added WjFlexGridCellTemplate.cell-overflow attribute that allows to change
      cells' style.overflow property declaratively.
    - Optimized grid scrolling performance (especially visible in IE).
* Bug fixes
    - columnLayout method did not work properly in IE9/10 (TFS 112895).
    - CollectionView notified before updating tracking arrays, should notify after.
    - Fixed issue with popup width (popups were sometimes wider than they should be).
    - Fixed old scrolling issue with IE and very large grids (100,000+ rows)
    - Fixed issue with hierarchical FlexGrid's (with childItemsPath assigned) Angular 
      cell templates for regular cells that didn't apply to group header cells.

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20151.42          Build Date: 03/17/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Optimized grid scrolling performance.
    - Added markers to indicate the position of rows and columns being dragged.
    - Improved behavior of drop-down grid cells on mobile devices.
    - Added select-all functionality when the user clicks the top-left fixed cell.
    - Changed row and column resize cursors to 'col-resize' and 'row-resize.'
    - Added a FlexGrid.deferResizing property to defer row and column resizing until the 
      user releases the mouse.
    - Added a Column.sortMemberPath property to sort columns based on an alternate binding.
    - Exposed wijmo.showPopup and hidePopup utility methods for positioning popup elements.
    - Added support for multi-item selection in the ListBox control. Set the checkedMemberPath 
      property to the name of a Boolean property in the itemsSource collection and the 
      ListBox adds checkboxes to each item, and fires the itemChecked event when
      the current item is checked or unchecked.
    - Deprecated and removed the wijmo.isTouchDevice method. The method
      actually tested the browser, not the device, so it was useless.
    - Added a LineMarker class to the wijmo.chart module that provides FlexChart with a 
      continuous data point information with optional directional lines  
      as mouse pointer moves over a chart surface.
    - Added a wijmo.chart.interaction extension module with a RangeSelector class
      that allows the user to choose the range of data to display on the specified FlexChart.
    - Added WjFlexGridCellTemplate directive for Angular that allows to define
      a custom template for any type of a FlexGrid cell (column and row headers,
      editing cell, and so on).
    - Cell templates now support element level directives.
    - Wijmo child directives for Angular (like WjFlexGridColumn or WjFlexChartSeries),
      when used in conjunction with ng-repeat directive, now support full-functional
      synchronization with ng-repeat's source array, including items order.

* Bug fixes
    - Fixed issues related to 'focusout,' which is not supported in FireFox.
    - Fixed FlexGrid.getCellBoundingRect so that it works correctly when dir="RTL."
    - Fixed a problem in chart selection when using itemFormatter.
    - Fixed the Clipboard so that it works on Apple OS (detects the 'Apple' key).
    - HitTestInfo.item returns correct value when chart is bounded to CollectionView.
    - Fixed rendering of merged cells when there are frozen areas (TFS 110627).
    - Fixed handling of IME text in ComboBox when isEditable = false (TFS 108547).

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20143.39        Build Date: 02/23/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Added a FlexGrid.sortRowIndex property. This property determines the index of 
      the row in the column headers panel that displays the sort icon and can be clicked
      to sort the column. By default, it is set to null, causing the last row in the 
      panel to be the 'sort row.'
    - Raise editing events when pasting data into the FlexGrid (this allows users to
      prevent overwriting of specific cells when pasting).
    - Improved column filters to work with complex properties (e.g. 'state.name', 'state.pop').
    - Exposed wijmo.Binding class used to work with complex properties.

* Bug fixes
    - Fixed several problems with rendering mixed chart types (TFS 96721, 98617).
    - Made pie chart handle negative data values correctly (TFS 89936).
    - Fixed a problem with the pie chart tooltip for the selected slice (TFS 108871).
    - Fixed a problem with chart tooltips in IE11 (TFS 109876).
    - Fixed InputMask cursor positioning on Safari (TFS 109969, 102148, 96927).
    - Fixed aggregate so that it updates correctly after adding new rows (TFS 109119).
    - Improved date/time detection in the FlexGridFilter editor (TFS 109409).
    - Prevented users from dragging rows below the new row template (TFS 109012).
    - Fixed RTL layout so that it works properly in Safari (TFS 109371).
    - Fixed cell templates so that they are honored in GroupRows (regression).
    - Fixed a problem with dropdown controls on mobile browsers.
    - Fixed Wijmo directives for Angular so that they work with the ng-inspector tool.

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20143.37        Build Date: 02/15/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Added wijmo.grid.grouppanel module with the GroupPanel control to provide drag&drop
      grouping functionality to the FlexGrid control.
    - Improved the CollectionView sorting logic to place nulls at the bottom of the list,
      regardless of sort direction (Excel behavior).
    - Allow initialization of ObservableArray in constructor.
    - Improved formatting of values in GroupRow node cells.
* Bug fixes
    - The data labels are not visible for data points outside plot area (TFS 109293).
    - Fixed problem with stacked charts when first series has custom chart type (TFS 107530).
    - Fixed problem with FlexGrid.autoSizeRows in grids with word-wrapping and merged columns.
    - Fixed problem with disappearing dropdown controls on mobile devices in case of zoomed in
      pages.
    - Fixed problem with AutoComplete in the Android 4.4.2 Browser where typed characters 
      can be swapped.

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20143.35        Build Date: 02/09/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Improved the grouping logic of paged CollectionViews to avoid splitting groups
      between pages and to include all items in aggregates (as opposed to items in
      the current page which was the previous behavior; TFS 139570).
    - Added a CollectionView.sortConverter property. The property specifies a function
      that can be used to customize the sorting behavior of the CollectionView.
    - Improved FlexGrid sorting to take dataMaps into account. Now the grid sorts based
      on display value (as opposed to raw data values which was the previous behavior).
    - Expanded grid keyboard handling: now ctrl+home and ctrl+end navigate to the
      first and last cells on the grid (as opposed to home/end, which navigate to the
      first and last cells on the current row).
    - Added Gauge.origin property. This property determines the starting point used
      for painting the pointer range. Setting it to null causes the gauge to use
      the min property or zero if the range extends from negative to positive values.
    - Clamp InputNumber value between min/max as the user types the value in.
    - Improved behavior of input controls on touch devices.
* Bug fixes
    - Fixed problem with FlexChart updating after changing collection (TFS 107253).
    - Fixed problem with FlexPie bound to CollectionView with currentPosition=-1 (TFS 106270).
    - Fixed problem with calculating axis limits in stacked chart with series that has
      custom chart-type (TFS 106988).
    - FlexPie labels rendered correctly when offset > 0 (TFS 105891).
    - Fixed problem with FlexChart axis minor ticks and grid lines (TFS 101264, 101401).
    - FlexChart legend and titles rendered with default text color (TFS 98329).
    - Fixed problem with rendering bubble and financial charts bound to CollectionView.
    - Fixed problem with FlexGrid when selectionMode == ListBox and empty item sources.
    - Fixed positioning of grid filter editor on frozen columns (TFS 105593).
    - Fixed problem with merging cells in group rows with aggregates (TFS 98610).
    - Allow clearing cells pressing Delete when column has map and is not required (TFS 107058).
    - Improved positioning of InputDate dropdown calendar (TFS 102162).
    - Fixed regression with dropdowns not showing in iOS Safari.

Build Number 5.20143.32      Build Date: 01/22/2015
=========================================================================================

* Bug fixes
    - Fixed problem with rendering axis minor ticks (TFS 102152).

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20143.30      Build Date: 01/15/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Added support of chart data labels(new properties FlexChart.dataLabel and
      FlexPie.dataLabel).
    - Added wijmo.grid.filter module with FlexGridFilter extension to provide
      Excel-style filtering in grid columns.
    - Added FlexGrid.getCellBoundingRect and GridPanel.getCellBoundingRect methods
      to retrieve the bounds of a given cell.
    - Added FlexGrid.formatItem event to allow multiple subscribers to customize cells
      (itemFormatter allows only one).
    - Added FlexGrid.AutoSizeMode property to customize auto-sizing behavior, as
      well as new events autoSizingColumn, autoSizedColumn, autoSizingRow, autoSizedRow.
    - Improved DropDown control behavior in clipping containers.
    - Added two new glyphs: .wj-glyph-check and .wj-glyph-filter.
    - Child Angular directives for Wijmo (like wj-flex-grid-column) can now be defined using
      the ng-repeat directive.
* Bug fixes
    - Fixed issue with freezing logic in merged cells.
    - Prevent startEditing from working on invisible rows/columns (TFS 100707).
    - Improved selection/sort behavior (TFS 100326).
    - Allow removing boolean values with delete key (TFS 96566).
    - Prevent dragging Group rows and New rows (TFS 88118).
    - Fixed position of drop-down arrows on RTL systems (TFS 97498).
    - Improved position and behavior of sorting glyph on merged columns (TFS 88149).
    - Improved behavior of selection while typing into AutoComplete (TFS 98114).

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20143.26      Build Date: 12/29/2014
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Added initialization options to wijmo.grid.Column constructor
    - Changed default color in InputColor and ColorPicker to white
    - Added support of logarithmic axes(new Axis logBase property).

* Bug fixes
    - Disabled cell templates in GroupRow cells
    - Improved freezing logic in GroupRow cells (TFS 98800)
    - Improved event logic in drop-down cells.
    - ng-style applied to the wj-flex-grid-column directive may cause changes in another
      column styles.

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20143.25      Build Date: 12/10/2014
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Added frozenRows and frozenColumns properties to the FlexGrid.
      Frozen cells are non-scrollable (like header cells) but can be selected and 
      edited (like regular cells).
    - Added Axis properties itemsSource, binding, itemFormatter. 
      The properties provide axis label customization.
    - Added Axis overlappingLabels property that controls appearance
      overlapped labels on axis. By default the overlapped labels are hidden.
    - Added event Axis.rangeChanged. 

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20143.24      Build Date: 12/10/2014
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Added InputColor and ColorPicker controls to wijmo.input module.
    - Added toHsb, toHsl, fromHsb, fromHsl methods to Color class.
    - Improved Globalize.formatNumber to honor the 'd' format as per the .NET spec.
      (e.g. Globalize.formatNumber(-1234, 'D6') == '-001234')
    - Added chart axis minor ticks and grid lines
      ('minorTickMarks', 'minorGrid' props in Axis class).
    - Added wijmo.chart.Axis.origin property
      This property allows to specify axis position inside plot area.
    - Added 'initialized' event and 'isInitialized' boolean property to Angular directives
      and Knockout Bindings. The property gets a true value and event is triggered after
      the directive has finished initialization of the control with values defined in
      its attributes and child directives.

* Bug fixes
    - CollectionView did not raise itemChanged when removing the current item
      and preserving the current position.

* Bug fixes
    - Fixed problem with column/bar width when using x-value data(TFS 97589). 

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20143.23      Build Date: 11/25/2014
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Removed Wijmo 5 dependency on jQuery.
        Starting with this version, Wijmo 5 has no dependencies on external libraries.
    - Added wijmo.grid.Column.showDropDown property
        This option adds drop-down buttons to cells.
        Clicking the button brings up a list based on the column's dataMap.
        This feature requires the wijmo.input module.

* Bug fixes
    - Improved handling of star-sized columns in auto-sized grids; previously the grid
      could sometimes leave room on the right for a scrollbar that wasn't there.

* Breaking changes
    - Calling the wijmo.grid.DataMap constructor with an itemsSource but no selectedValuePath
      or displayMemberPath parameters used to create integer keys for the values; now the 
      array values are used both as values and as keys; this is more convenient for creating
      lists of strings that can be used with drop-downs and avoids the creation of arbitrary
      (and meaningless) keys.

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20143.22      Build Date: 11/11/2014

    - added InputMask control (see http://wijmo.com/5/docs/topic/wijmo.input.InputMask.Class.html)
    - added Clipboard class (see http://wijmo.com/5/docs/topic/wijmo.Clipboard.Class.html)
    - added 'invalidateAll' static method to Control class.
    - added 'mask' property to InputDate, InputTime controls
    - added 'mask', 'required', 'inputType' properties to FlexGrid.column class
    - added clipboard support in FlexGrid
      ('autoClipboard' prop, 'pasting', 'pasted', 'copying', 'copied' events)
    - added 'rendering' event in FlexChart
    - added multi-axis support to FlexChart 
      ('axisX', 'axisY' props in Axis class and 'axes' collection in FlexChart class)
    - added 'labelAngle' property to chart Axis class.
    - improved on-line help (show/hide inherited members, collapse/expand properties/events/methods).
    - added wijmo.animate method (mainly to avoid dependency on jQuery)

* Bug fixes
    - Could not drag FlexGrid columns one position to the right...
    - Corrected Japanese localization settings in the wijmo.culture.ja.js file.
