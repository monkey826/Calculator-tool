<h2>Angular 2 Markup Syntax</h2>
<p>
    Wijmo Angular 2 components use consistent naming conventions for specifying them in template
    markup. The HTML element and attribute names used for components can be easily inferred from
    component class and member names by using the following simple rules:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        HTML element name representing a Wijmo <b>component</b> is specified using lower-case-dash syntax.
        For example, <b>WjInputNumber</b> component should be spelled as <b>wj-input-number</b>:
        <pre>&lt;wj-input-number [(value)]="amount"&gt;&lt;/wj-input-number&gt;</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        Wijmo attribute <b>directives</b> use camel case form for their class names, that is,
        it is a class name with the first letter in lower case. For example, <b>WjFlexGridCellTemplate</b>
        directive is defined using the <b>wjFlexGridCellTemplate</b> attribute:
        <pre>&lt;template wjFlexGridCellTemplate [cellType]="'Cell'"&gt;&lt;/template&gt;</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        Names of the attributes representing Wijmo component properties and events exactly coincide with the
        property and event names exposed off the component class interface.
        Property names must be enclosed in square brackets for one-way binding (e.g. <b>[isReadOnly]</b>) and
        square brackets plus parentheses for two-way binding (e.g. <b>[(value)]</b>). Event names must be
        enclosed in parentheses (e.g. <b>(valueChanged)</b>). For example:
        <pre>&lt;wj-input-number 
    [(value)]="amount" // two-way binding to a component property
    [format]="'n0'" // one-way binding to string
    [isReadOnly]="true" // one-way binding to boolean
    (valueChanged)="valueChanged($event)"&gt; // event binding
&lt;/wj-input-number&gt;</pre>

        Note that binding expression should evaluate to a value of the same type as the property type
        it is assigned to. In the above example, the <b>format</b> string type property is assigned with
        <b>'n0'</b> enclosed in single quotes, which represents a string literal. If we omit quotes and just specify
        <b>n0</b>, then such an expression will be treated as a property name. Similarly, <b>isReadOnly</b>
        boolean property is bound to <b>true</b> where the latter is specified without quotes,
        because <b>true</b> is a boolean type constant while <b>'true'</b> surrounded by single quotes would
        denote a string literal.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Event binding details</h3>
<p>
    Wijmo event handlers are defined as functions with two parameters: sender and event argument.
    Angular 2 <b>EventEmitter</b> implementation allows passing of only a single parameter from an event
    initiator to the subscribers, which is accessible as a value of the <b>$event</b> local variable in template
    markup. Wijmo events pass an event argument in this parameter. For example:
</p>
<pre>&lt;wj-flex-grid 
    [itemsSource]="data"
    (deletingRow)="beforeDelete($event)"&gt; // $event contains CellRangeEventArgs object here
&lt;/wj-flex-grid&gt;</pre>
<p>
    If you want to additionally receive a sender in an event handler, as it happens when you subscribe
    to Wijmo control events in TypeScript/JavaScript code, all you need to do is add a local template variable
    to the component and pass it to the event handler along with the event argument:
</p>
<pre>&lt;wj-flex-grid #flex // 'flex' local variable references the grid component instance
    [itemsSource]="data"
    (deletingRow)="beforeDelete(flex, $event)"&gt; // pass sender ('flex') and event arguments ($event) to the handler
&lt;/wj-flex-grid&gt;</pre>

<h3>The "initialized" Event</h3>
<p>
    All Wijmo Angular 2 components include an "initialized" event that is raised after the control 
    has been added to the page and initialized.
</p>
<p>
    You can use this event to perform additional initalization in addition
    to setting properties in markup. For example:
</p>
<pre>&lt;wj-flex-grid #flex (initialized)="initGrid(flex)"&gt;
&lt;/wj-flex-grid&gt;</pre>

<pre>// implementation
export class AppComponent {
    constructor() {
        this.data = ...;
    }
  
    // add custom merge manager to the FlexGrid
    initGrid(flex) {
        flex.mergeManager = new CustomMerge(flex);
    }
}</pre>
