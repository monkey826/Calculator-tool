<h2>
    Wijmo and HTML Events</h2>
<p>
    HTML5 has an eventing mechanism that works for HTML elements, but cannot be used to 
    add events to arbitrary objects, such as controls and collections.</p>
<p>
    Because of this, Wijmo defines an <b>Event</b> class that is used for implementing
    all events for all Wijmo classes. 
    The main differences between Wijmo and HTML events are:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Wijmo events may be declared by any class (not just HTML elements).</li>
    <li>
        Wijmo events are lighter than HTML events, because do not have routing (capturing and bubbling).
        They target only the object that declared the event.</li>
    <li>
        You can add and remove Wijmo event handlers by calling the event's <b>addHandler</b> and 
        <b>removeHandler</b> methods (as opposed to the <b>addEventListener</b> and 
        <b>removeEventListner</b> methods used with HTML events).</li>
    <li>
        Every Wijmo event handler takes two parameters: (a) the event sender, and (b) the event arguments.</li>
    <li>
        Wijmo follows a pattern where event "XYZ" is raised by a corresponding method "onXYZ", which can be 
        overridden by derived classes to handle the event without attaching any handlers or to customize 
        or even suppress the event.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    Wijmo events do not replace HTML events. Applications typically use both. 
    HTML events are used to handle mouse and keyboard interactions that target a control's <b>hostElement</b> 
    or elements defined in the control template.
    Wijmo events are used to handle control-specific events that are not directly related to the DOM. 
    For example, <b>valueChanged</b> or <b>rowAdded</b>.</p>
<p>
    The example below shows how you can add handlers to HTML and Wijmo events on an <b>InputNumber</b>
    control using plain JavaScript:</p>

<pre>// create the control
var ctl = new wijmo.input.InputNumber('#inputNumber');

// attach a Wijmo event handler
ctl.valueChanged.addHandler(function (s, e) {
    console.log('the value has changed to ' + s.value);
});

// attach an HTML event handler
ctl.addEventListener(ctl.hostElement, 'keypress', function(e) {
    console.log('you pressed ' + e.charCode);
});</pre>

<p>
    The example above shows the syntax using plain JavaScript. Applications that use frameworks such
    as Angular, Knockout, Aurelia, or Vue have to use the syntax dictated by the framework.</p>
<p>
    For example, an Angular 1.x would attach a handler to the <b>valueChanged</b> Wijmo event this way:</p>
<pre>&lt;wj-input-number
    value-changed="myValueChangedEventHander(s, e)"&gt;...</pre>

<p>
    In Angular2, you would do this instead:</p>
<pre>&lt;wj-input-number #theControl
    (value-changed)="myValueChangedEventHander(theControl, $event)"&gt;...</pre>
