ServerCollectionView
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shows how to implement a CollectionView class that retrieves data from a server.

The sample implements a very simple data service (with paging and sorting) and
a ServerCollectionView class that runs on the client.

The ServerCollectionView uses the simple service to retrieve data
with sorting and paging parameters as requested by the client.
