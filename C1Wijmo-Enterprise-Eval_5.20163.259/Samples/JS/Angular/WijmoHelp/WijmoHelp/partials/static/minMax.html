<h2>
    Using the min and max properties</h2>
<p>
    Several Wijmo controls have <b>min</b> and <b>max</b> properties
    that can be used to restrict values entered by users. 
    Wijmo controls with <b>min</b> and <b>max</b> properties include
    <b>Gauge</b>, <b>Calendar</b>, <b>InputDate</b>, <b>InputNumber</b>, 
    and <b>InputNumber</b>.
<p>
    The behavior of the <b>min</b> and <b>max</b> properties is the 
    same for all controls: if specified (they may be set to null),
    the control will apply them as constraints on the value of the
    <b>value</b> property. Users will not be able to change the control
    value to anything smaller than <b>min</b> or larger than <b>max</b>.</p>
<p>
    This behavior is different from the <b>min</b> attribute of standard
    HTML <b>input</b> elements, which does allow users to enter invalid
    values and raise validation errors. The Wijmo controls simply prevent
    invalid values from being entered at all.</p>
<p>
    However, note that the <b>min</b> and <b>max</b> properties only 
    restrict the values that the user can enter. They do <b>not</b> restrict 
    the values that can be assigned to the control in code or via bindings.</p>
<p>
    Therefore, if your code sets or changes the value of the <b>min</b> and 
    <b>max</b> properties, and you want these limits to be applied to the 
    current control value, you must do that in code as well.</p>
<p>
    For example:</p>
<pre>
// 'ctl' is any Wijmo control with min/max properties, including
// Gauge, Calendar, InputDate, InputNumber, and InputNumber.
//
// apply new bounds for the value
ctl.min = newMinValue;
ctl.max = newMaxValue;
//
// ensure that the control value is within the new bounds
ctl.value = wijmo.clamp(ctl.value, ctl.min, ctl.max); 
</pre>
