<h2>
    Pseudo Classes</h2>
<p>
    CSS pseudo-classes are keywords added to selectors that specifies a special state of the 
    element to be selected. For example, <code>:hover</code> will apply a style when the user 
    hovers over the element specified by the selector.</p>
<p>
    Pseudo-classes are important in forms because they let you apply styles to elements not 
    only in relation to the content of the document tree, but also in relation to external 
    factors like whether the element has the focus (<code>:focus</code>) or is in an invalid 
    state (<code>:invalid</code>).
<p>
    Some of the standard pseudo-classes are limited in their usefulness because they apply 
    only to specific elements, and not to the elements ancestors. For example, many Wijmo 
    input controls contain input elements; when the input elements have the focus, 
    the inner input element get the <code>:focus</code> pseudo-class, but the control 
    host that contains it does not.</p>
<p>
    For this reason, Wijmo adds some pseudo-classes of its own to make building effective forms easier:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>wj-state-focused</b>: Added to control host elements when the control <b>contains</b> the 
        active element (not necessarily when the host element <b>is</b> the active element).</li>
    <li>
        <b>wj-state-invalid</b>: Added to control host elements when the control contains input 
        elements in an invalid state.</li>
    <li>
        <b>wj-state-empty</b>: Added to control host elements when the control contains an input 
        element with no content (this is different from the <code>:empty</code> pseudo-class which 
        is applied to elements that have no children.</li>
    <li>
        <b>wj-state-readonly</b>: Added to control host elements when the control's <b>isReadOnly</b>
        property is set to true.</li>
    <li>
        <b>wj-state-disabled</b>: Added to control host elements when the control's <b>isDisabled</b>
        property is set to true (which corresponds to adding a "disabled" attribute to the control's
        host element).</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The fiddle below shows an example of how you can use the <b>wj-state-focused</b> pseudo-class to
    apply CSS animations to the thumb element of linear and radial gauges when they get the focus.</p>
