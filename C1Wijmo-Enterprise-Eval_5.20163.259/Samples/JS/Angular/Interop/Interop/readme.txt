Interop
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shows advanced data-binding scenarios using Wijmo and different application frameworks.

This version of the sample uses AngularJS 1.x and the wijmo.angular.js interop module. 
Other versions of the sample are available using other frameworks, including 
React and Vue.

Together, the samples demonstrate the differences between popular frameworks and 
also Wijmo's framework-agnostic nature. Wijmo will work great with whatever 
framework you pick.
