ColumnPicker (Angular 2)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Shows how you add a column picker to the FlexGrid.

The sample implements a column picker as an AngularJS directive. 
To use the directive, add it to the grid markup as follows:

<pre>
    <wj-flex-grid style="max-height:350px"                  
                  [columnPicker]="'images/colpicker.png'"
                  [itemsSource]="data">
    </wj-flex-grid>
</pre>

The value of the columnPicker directive/parameter represents an
image to be displayed at the top-right of the grid.

Clicking the image shows a drop-down with a list of checkboxes 
representing the grid columns. The user may toggle the column
visibility by clicking the checkboxes.
