Flyout (Angular 2)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shows how you can add fly-out menus to FlexGrid column headers.

The sample defines a FlexGridFlyout class that monitors the mouse and displays
a "flyout" element when the user hovers over a column header.

The "flyout" element has arbitrary content and event handlers that can be used
to perform actions on the current column.
