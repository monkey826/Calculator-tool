Interop
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shows advanced data-binding scenarios using Wijmo and different application frameworks.

This version of the sample uses React and the wijmo.react.js interop module. 
Other versions of the sample are available using other frameworks, including 
Angular and Vue.

Together, the samples demonstrate the differences between popular frameworks and 
also Wijmo's framework-agnostic nature. Wijmo will work great with whatever 
framework you pick.

Implementation note: the various versions of the Interop sample were written to 
highlight the differences between frameworks. For this reason, we decided to
implement the whole application as a single React component instead of breaking
it up into a hierarchy of simpler components. The latter would have been a better
choice for the React implementation but would have made the sample substantially 
different from the other versions.
