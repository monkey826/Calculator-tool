            <p>
                The sample demonstrates how to customize event template to the events calendar.
            </p>
            <p>Events used in the sample:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>eventCreating</strong> - occurs before the event markup is creating.
                    Event parameters: e - jQuery.Event object. args - event arguments:
                    args.data - the event object data,
                    args.eventTemplate - The template of events displayed on the view, set this arguments will customize the events.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Below is the event object syntax which is passing to eventCreating event handler (args.data).
            </p>
    <pre>
        id - String, unique event id, this field generated automatically;
        calendar - String, calendar id to which the event belongs;
        subject - String, event title;
        location - String, event location;
        start - Date, start date/time;
        end - Date, end date/time;
        description - String, event description;
        color - String, event color;
        allday - Boolean, indicates all day event
        tag - String, this field can be used to store custom information.
        parentRecurrenceId - String, id of the event object that 
            defines the recurrence criteria for this event object. 
            If an event is recurring it represents an occurrence in the series that is 
            started and defined by a specific pattern event. 
            Use the getPatern method in order to obtain the pattern 
            of the current event. A pattern event can be recognized by its 
            recurrenceState field set to the "master" value. 
            The recurrence information defined by the pattern event
            can be accessed  via the recurrencePattern field of the event. 
            If this event is a not member of a recurrence, 
            or is itself a root event, this field will be null. 
        recurrenceState - String, indicates the recurrence state of the event. 
            (possible values are "notRecurring"(or null), "master", "occurrence", 
            "exception", "removed")
        recurrencePattern - Object, represents the recurrence attributes 
            of an event. Only master events can have this field
            (recurrenceState is "master")
            Object syntax:
                parentRecurrenceId - String, id of the event object
                    which represents the master event for this 
                    recurrencePattern object.
                recurrenceType - String, determines the type of recurrence:
                    daily - the recurring event reoccurs on a daily basis.
                    workdays - the recurring event reoccurs every working day.
                    monthly - the recurring event reoccurs on a monthly basis. 
                    monthlyNth - the recurring event reoccurs every N months. 
                    weekly - the recurring event reoccurs on a weekly basis.
                    yearly - the recurring event reoccurs on an yearly basis.
                    yearlyNth - the recurring event reoccurs every N years.
                interval - Number, specifies the interval between occurrences 
                    of the recurrence. 
                    The interval field works in conjunction with 
                    the "recurrenceType" field to determine the cycle of the recurrence. 
                    The maximum allowable value is 99 for weekly patterns and 999 
                    for daily patterns.
                    The default value is 1.
                    For example, if the recurrenceType is set 
                    to daily, and the "interval" is set to 3, 
                    the recurrence will occur every third day.
                startTime - Date, indicates the start time for the given 
                    occurrence of the recurrence pattern. 
                endTime - Date, indicates the end time for the given 
                    occurrence of the recurrence pattern. 
                patternStartDate - Date, indicates the start date of the 
                    recurrence pattern.
                patternEndDate - Date, indicates the end date of the 
                    recurrence pattern.
                    This field is optional but must be coordinated 
                    with other fields when setting up a recurrence pattern. 
                    If this field or the "occurrences" field is set, 
                    the pattern is considered to be finite, and the "noEndDate"
                    field is false. 
                    If neither "patternEndDate" nor "occurrences" is set, 
                    the pattern is considered infinite and "noEndDate" is true. 
                    The "interval" field must be set before 
                    setting "patternEndDate".
                occurrences - Number, the number of occurrences for the 
                    recurrence pattern.	This field allows the definition of 
                    a recurrence pattern that is only valid for the specified 
                    number of subsequent occurrences. 
                    For example, you can set this property to 10 for a formal 
                    training  course that will be held on the next ten Thursday 
                    evenings. The default value is 0. This field must be 
                    coordinated with other fields when setting up a recurrence pattern. 
                    If the "patternEndDate" field or the "occurrences" field 
                    is set, the pattern is considered to be finite and the 
                    "noEndDate" field is false. 
                    If neither "patternEndDate" nor "occurrences" is set, 
                    the pattern is considered infinite and "noEndDate" is true.
                instance - String, determines the week in a month in which 
                    the event will occur. This field is only valid for recurrences of 
                    the "monthlyNth" and "yearlyNth" types and allows the definition 
                    of a recurrence pattern that is only valid for the Nth occurrence, 
                    such as "the 2nd Sunday in March" pattern. 
                    The default value is "first".
                    Possible values are:
                        first - the recurring event will occur on the specified 
                            day or days of the first week in the month. 
                        second - The recurring event will occur on the specified 
                            day or days of the second week in the month. 
                        third = - The recurring event will occur on the specified 
                            day or days of the third week in the month. 
                        fourth - The recurring event will occur on the specified 
                            day or days of the fourth week in the month.
                        last - The recurring event will occur on the specified 
                            day or days of the last week in the month. 
                dayOfWeekMask - String, contains set of values representing the mask 
                    for week days on which the recurring event occurs. 
                    Monthly and yearly patterns are only valid for a single day. 
                    The default value is "none".
                    When the "RecurrenceType" field is set to "daily", 
                    the "DayOfWeekMask" field can only be set to "everyDay"; 
                    setting the field to any other value will result in an exception.
                    When the "recurrenceType" field is set to 
                    "workdays", the "dayOfWeekMask" field 
                    can only be set to "workDays"; setting the field 
                    to any other value will result in an exception.
                    When the "recurrenceType" field is set to 
                    "weekly", the "dayOfWeekMask" field 
                    cannot be set to "none"; doing so will result 
                    in an exception being thrown.
                    When the recurrenceType" field is set to 
                    "monthly" or "yearly" the "dayOfWeekMask" field is not applicable.
                    Possible values are:
                        none - no specific value; the actual value is obtained from 
                            the root event object. 
                        sunday - specifies Sunday.
                        monday - Specifies Monday.
                        tuesday - Specifies Tuesday. 
                        wednesday - Specifies Wednesday.
                        thursday - Specifies Thursday.
                        friday - Specifies Friday.
                        saturday - Specifies Saturday.
                        weekendDays - Specifies Saturday and Sunday (or what ever days according 
                            to the settings of the C1EventsCalendar).
                        workDays - Specifies work days (all days except weekend).
                        everyDay - Specifies every day of the week.
                dayOfMonth - Number, the number of the day in its respective month on which 
                    each occurrence will occur. Applicable only when the recurrenceType 
                    field is set to "monthly" or "yearly".
                    The default value is 1.
                monthOfYear - Number, indicates which month of the year is valid 
                    for the specified recurrence pattern. Can be a number from 1 to 12.
                    This field is only valid for recurrence patterns whose recurrenceType" 
                    field is set to "yearlyNth" or "yearly".
                    The default value is 1.
                noEndDate - Boolean, indicates if the recurrence pattern is endless.
                    The default value is True. This field must be coordinated with 
                    other fields when setting up a recurrence pattern. If the patternEndDate field
                    or the occurrences field is set, the pattern is considered 
                    to be finite and the "noEndDate" field is false. 
                    If neither patternEndDate nor occurrences is set, 
                    the pattern is considered infinite and "noEndDate" is true.
                exceptions - Array, holds the list of event object ids that 
                    define the exceptions to that series of events. 
                    This field is read-only.
                removedOccurrences - Array, holds the list of event object's ids
                    removed from that series of events.
