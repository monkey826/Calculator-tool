Shows how to create and use directives in Angular applications.

Directives encapsulate HTML and javascript into re-usable units that can be tested 
and maintained independently. Using directives is very easy, all you have to do is 
include the directive definitions in your HTML pages and then use the directive 
tags as you would any regular HTML tag. Parameters are passed as regular attributes,
and they can be data-bound.

Wijmo ships with Angular directives for all its widgets. This makes it easy to develop 
and maintain AngularJS applications, with views that contain pure markup and little 
or no script.

This sample also includes directives for common UI elements in jQueryUI, Bootstrap, 
and Google jsapi, so you can focus on writing views and controllers.

You can use all these directives as they are or customize them to fit your needs.
