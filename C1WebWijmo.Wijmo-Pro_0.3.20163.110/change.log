swapping out jQuery UI for jQuery Mobile, you can convert your widgets to be mobile without changing 
a single line of code! Wijmo is offering something that no other tool can: a set of widgets that 
automatically adapts to its environment.

AppView (new)
-------
AppView is an all-in-one widget for mobile applications. It has built-in navigation, ajax-loaded 
content and a responsive layout system. AppView is ideal for building a single application that 
works on both phones and tablets while optimizing screen real estate. 

ListView (new)
--------
ListView is an extension of jQuery Mobile ListView. Lists are used for data display, navigation, 
result lists, and data entry so jQuery Mobile includes a wide range of list types and formatting 
examples to cover most common design patterns. They support a wide array of features such as: 
read-only, linked, numbered, nested, collapsible lists and more. See jQuery Mobiles ListView 
docs for more.

--------------
Wijmo Data is a very light DataView API that is easily extended with Adapters. 
We provide the following adapters
	wijmo.data.arraydataview.js - For working with local arrays of data
	wijmo.data.wijdatasource.js - For backaward compatibility with wijdatasource in wijgrid
	wijmo.data.ajax.js - (optional) For general ajax request including JSONP support
	wijmo.data.breeze.js - (optional) For seamless integration with BreezeJS
